# movies-app

A simple movies app, built with the PERN stack. Movies are hard-coded into a Postgres database for now.

# Future Improvements

I'd like to implement the editing of movie details, as well as the ability to add new movies.

# Install

`yarn && yarn client-install`

# Config

Create a `.env` file with a Postgres `DB_URI=` connection string.

# Dev

`yarn dev`
